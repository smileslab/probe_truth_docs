# Generate Forensic Report

After completing the media inspection, you can generate a comprehensive PDF report summarizing the results of the deepfake detection process. This report can be downloaded and printed for legal, forensic, or internal documentation purposes.

## How It Works

Once the media has been analyzed and predictions are available, clicking the **"Generate Report"** button will:

1. Compile all analysis results.
2. Structure the content into a formal forensic report.
3. Provide a downloadable **PDF file** with optional print support.

## Report Contents

The generated report includes the following sections:

#### 1. General Information
- Media ID
- Upload timestamp
- Media type (video, audio, image)
- File name and format
- User or API key identifier (if applicable)

#### 2. Metadata Information
- Resolution / duration / size
- File properties and encoding format
- Hash or unique media signature

#### 3. Model Analysis Summary
- List of models used for analysis
- Individual predictions with confidence scores
- Verdicts (e.g., Authentic / Deepfake)

#### 4. Explanation &  Evidence
- Key frame thumbnails (for video/image)
- Audio waveform or spectrogram (for audio)
- Highlighted anomalies (if supported)

#### 5. Final Verdict
- Overall decision (e.g., Deepfake Detected)
- Confidence level
- Timestamp of decision

## Download & Print

- The generated report is available in **PDF format**.
- Users can **download** or **print** directly from the browser.
- Reports can also be accessed later via the media history panel (if enabled).

<pre>
```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
MEDIA_ID = '123456789abcdef'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',

## Developer Notes

- This endpoint will return the PDF file directly in the response body as a binary stream.
- Ensure you write the response content to a .pdf file on your local system.
- Make sure the analysis is complete before calling this endpoint â€” otherwise you may receive an error.
