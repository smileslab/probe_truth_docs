# Generate Forensic Report

After completing the media inspection, you can generate a comprehensive PDF report summarizing the results of the deepfake detection process. This report can be downloaded and printed for legal, forensic, or internal documentation purposes.

## How It Works

Once the media has been analyzed and predictions are available, clicking the **"Generate Report"** button will:

1. Compile all analysis results.
2. Structure the content into a formal forensic report.
3. Provide a downloadable **PDF or JSON file** with optional print support.
